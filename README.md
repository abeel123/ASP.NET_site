# ASP.Net Blog
This project is meant to be a learning experience. I hope to design a simple blog to explore the ASP.NET framework and its libraries. The blog should be connected to a SQL server to store blog posts. This project will help me expand on my current skills around web development and database management. This website will explore the MVC architecture. 

So far, I have implemented the connection to MSSQL. The next steps include building an CRUD API for front to back end communication, along with designing and implementing the website's components.
